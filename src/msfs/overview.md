## Pre-Flight

Prior to entering the aircraft, the crew can go around the plane and inspect it
for flight readiness, check control surfaces or remove safety pins.

## Navigation

The Phantom carries multiple systems designed specifically for communication and
navigation with military systems.

To improve integration with MSFS and civilian systems, the aircraft was slightly
adjusted where applicable.

### Radio

The UHF Radio carried by the F-4E normally operates in the military frequency
range from 225.0 MHz to 399.95 MHz.

For MSFS the radio was adopted to instead cover the civilian range from 100 MHz
to 199.95 MHz.

### VOR/ILS

> ðŸš§ Details of changes. What about NDB?

## Weapons

The aircraft can be equipped with **cosmetic-only** weapons through a loadout
selection interface.
