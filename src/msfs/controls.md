# Controls

The cockpit is fully interactive; every switch, button and knob can be
interacted with.

Additionally, MSFS allows binding commonly used commands directly to physical
hardware, such as joysticks or throttles.

The following table shows which common binds are connected to which control in
the cockpit.
